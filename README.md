# p4ignore for use with the Helix Core version control system

`.p4ignore` is a compilation of useful files and folders to exclude when using version control with Unreal Engine.

### Important
Set the `P4IGNORE` environment variable for your project to use the `.p4ignore` file, enter the following in your terminal:

`p4 set P4IGNORE=.p4ignore`

***If you don't do this, p4v won't read your file!!***
